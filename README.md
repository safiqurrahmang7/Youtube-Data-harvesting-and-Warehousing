**Project Overview:**
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at providing users with the capability to access and analyze data from various YouTube channels. The project utilizes SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to develop a user-friendly application allowing users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**
This project utilizes the following components:
- **Streamlit**: Used to create a user-friendly UI for interacting with the application.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development.
- **Google API Client**: Facilitates communication with YouTube's Data API v3 for data retrieval.
- **MongoDB**: Document database used for storing structured or unstructured data.
- **PostgreSQL**: Highly scalable database management system for managing structured data.

**Ethical Perspective on YouTube Data Scraping:**
The project emphasizes ethical considerations when scraping YouTube content, including adherence to terms and conditions, obtaining authorization, and ensuring data protection. Responsible handling of collected data is crucial to maintain privacy, confidentiality, and prevent misuse or misrepresentation.

**Required Libraries:**
- googleapiclient.discovery
- streamlit
- psycopg2
- pymongo
- pandas

**Features:**
- Retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube using the YouTube API.
- Storage of data in MongoDB as a data lake.
- Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
- Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using different search options.
